          <h3>2nd Year Project</h3> 
		  <p><img src="img/2ndYearProject.jpg" width="500" height="300"></p>
		  <p>Developed a Technology accessories selling website. We created an online website
		     that allowed you to buy products just like you would on amazon. As a shopper you can make an account, login
			 purchase goods, put in credit card details etc. As an admin you can add, delete and update products.</p>
		  <h3>3rd Year Project</h3>
		  <p><img src="img/3rdYearProject1.jpg" width="350" height="250"><img src="img/3rdYearProject2.jpg" width="350" height="250"></p>
		  <p>I developed a Bullet Hell style game, which was a mixture of two ideas, Space Invaders and Pokemon Platinum that was created 
			 for the Nintendo DS Lite. It is a fun and exciting game that we developed using JavaScript. It was a fun project
			 to do and very long. The game has no heavy system requirements, just a web browser with internet connection.</p>
		  <h3>4th Year Project</h3>
		  <p>For my final year project i am looking to make a data visualization of the EC2 instance spot prices. I plan to 
		     achieve this by web scraping Amazonx spot price website and then filtering the data using Ben Frys seven steps 
			 and to finally visualize it using D3 libraries for JavaScript</p>
